# Linked List

## Overview
A **Linked List** is a linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes. Each node consists of:
1. **Data (Element)**: The value stored in the node.
2. **Pointer/Reference**: Points to the next (and/or previous) node.

---

## Types of Linked Lists:

### 1. Singly Linked List (SLL)
- **Structure**: Each node points to the next node. The last node points to `null`.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Unidirectional traversal (from head to tail).
  - Simple and memory efficient compared to DLL.
- **Representation**:
  ```
  Head -> [Data|Next] -> [Data|Next] -> [Data|Null]
  ```

---

### 2. Doubly Linked List (DLL)
- **Structure**: Each node points to both its next and previous nodes.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Allows bidirectional traversal.
  - Slightly higher memory overhead due to the extra pointer.
- **Representation**:
  ```
  Null <- [Prev|Data|Next] <-> [Prev|Data|Next] <-> [Prev|Data|Null]
  ```

---

### 3. Circular Linked List (CLL)
- **Structure**: The last node points back to the first node, forming a circle.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Can be either singly or doubly linked.
  - Useful for applications where traversal happens in a loop.
- **Representation**:
  ```
  [Data|Next] -> [Data|Next] -> [Data|Next] -+
        ^------------------------------------+
  ```

## Key Patterns in LinkedList Problems:
1. **Traversal**:
   - Iterating through nodes (e.g., printing values).
2. **Insertion**:
   - Adding a node at the head, tail, or a specific position.
3. **Deletion**:
   - Removing a node (by value or position).
4. **Reversal**:
   - Reversing the linked list.

## Common LinkedList Interview Questions:
1. How do you detect a cycle in a LinkedList? (Floydâ€™s Cycle Detection Algorithm)
2. Reverse a LinkedList (iteratively and recursively).
3. Merge two sorted LinkedLists.
4. Find the middle element of a LinkedList in one pass.
5. Remove duplicates from a sorted LinkedList.
6. Delete a node in a singly linked list given only access to that node.
7. Rotate a LinkedList by K nodes.
8. Check if a LinkedList is a palindrome.
9. Flatten a multilevel doubly linked list.

---

## Practice Questions:
1. Write a function to insert a node at the beginning of a singly linked list.
2. Implement a method to delete the last node of a doubly linked list.
3. Detect and remove a loop in a circular linked list.
4. Find the nth node from the end of a singly linked list.
5. Partition a linked list around a value `x` such that all nodes less than `x` come before nodes greater than or equal to `x`.
6. Convert a binary tree to a doubly linked list.
7. Implement a circular linked list with methods for insertion, deletion, and traversal.
