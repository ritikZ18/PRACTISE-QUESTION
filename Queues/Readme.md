- **Dequeue Operation:** Removing an element from the front moves the `front` pointer forward. If `front` reaches the end, it wraps around similarly.

## 7. How to Approach DSA Questions Involving Queues

When you encounter problems involving queues, follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Problem Requirements:**
 - Identify if the problem naturally fits a FIFO pattern.
 - Common examples include scheduling, processing tasks in order, and level-order traversal of trees.

2. **Clarify Constraints:**
 - Determine if the queue needs to be fixed-size (array-based) or dynamic (linked list-based).
 - Check for performance constraintsâ€”most queue operations are \(O(1)\).

3. **Plan the Operations:**
 - Write down the necessary operations (enqueue, dequeue, peek, etc.).
 - Consider edge cases (empty queue, full queue).

4. **Choose the Right Implementation:**
 - **Array Implementation:** Good for bounded queues; use circular logic to avoid wasted space.
 - **Linked List Implementation:** Use when you need a dynamically sized queue.

5. **Sketch a Diagram:**
 - Draw the queue before and after each operation to understand pointer movements.
 - Diagrams help in visualizing circular behavior and pointer updates.

6. **Write Pseudocode First:**
 - Outline your logic step by step.
 - Ensure you handle boundary conditions (empty/full states).

7. **Translate Pseudocode to Code:**
 - Use your preferred programming language.
 - Test with simple examples and edge cases.

8. **Analyze Complexity:**
 - Verify that each operation (enqueue, dequeue, etc.) operates in constant time, \(O(1)\).

## 8. Variations and Advanced Queue Concepts 

- **Double-Ended Queue (Deque):** Supports insertion and deletion at both the front and rear.
- **Priority Queue:** Elements are ordered based on priority rather than strictly by insertion order.
- **Queue using Stacks:** Sometimes interview questions ask you to implement a queue using two stacks.
- **Circular Queue:** As discussed, efficiently uses array space by treating the array as circular.

---

## 9. Summary

- **Queue** is a FIFO data structure.
- **Core Operations:** Enqueue, Dequeue, Peek, isEmpty, and isFull.
- **Implementations:** Can be implemented using arrays (with circular logic) or linked lists.
- **Approach:** Understand requirements, plan operations, sketch diagrams, write pseudocode, and then code.
- **Applications:** Used in real-world scenarios like scheduling, BFS, buffering, etc.

By understanding the underlying principles, operations, and implementation details, you'll be well-equipped to solve a wide variety of DSA problems involving queues.

Happy coding and problem-solving!
